# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning
Developed a sentiment analysis system using Python. Preprocessed text using `re` for cleaning, `nltk` for tokenization, and `string` for removing punctuation. Used `pandas` and `numpy` for data handling, and visualized trends with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. Suppressed warnings with `warnings` for smooth execution.
